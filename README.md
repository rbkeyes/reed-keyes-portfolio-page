# reed-keyes-portfolio-page

## Description

I designed this webpage to serve as a portfolio to showcase my professional work as a developer and beyond (Note: at this time, I am still working to build my portfolio as a web developer. In the meantime, I have provided links to my publications and teaching as placeholders, with the intention of creating either a separate section or entirely new page for these categories at a future date). This was an excellent opportunity for me to practice flexbox in order to create a responsive portfolio page.

## Usage

This page includes intra-page navigation links in both the header and footer to the "About Me", "My Work" and "Contact Me" sections of the page. The images in the "My Work" serve as hyperlinks to my project pages. There links to my email and social media in both the "Contact Me" section as well as the page footer. The format of the page adjusts as screen width decreases, to improve ease of viewing across a wide array of devices.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
